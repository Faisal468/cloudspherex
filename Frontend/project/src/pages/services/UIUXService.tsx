          question: 'Whats the difference between UI and UX design?',
          answer: 'UI (User Interface) design focuses on the visual elements of a digital product—how it looks, including colors, typography, buttons, and other visual components. UX (User Experience) design is broader and focuses on the entire user journey—how it works and feels, including information architecture, user flows, wireframes, and ensuring the product is intuitive and enjoyable to use. While distinct, these disciplines work together closely to create effective digital products.'

          question: 'How long does the UI/UX design process typically take?',
          answer: 'The timeline varies depending on the complexity of the project. A simple website redesign might take 4-6 weeks, while a complex application with extensive user research could take 3-4 months. We provide a detailed timeline during the planning phase based on your specific requirements and project scope.'

          question: 'Do you provide design implementation services or just the designs?',
          answer: 'We offer both design and implementation services. Our designers work closely with our development team to ensure designs are implemented accurately and efficiently. We can deliver designs as Figma/Sketch files for your development team, or we can handle the full implementation process, turning designs into functional code.'

          question: 'How do you ensure designs will work well across different devices and screen sizes?',
          answer: 'We follow responsive design principles, creating designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. We design with a mobile-first approach when appropriate and test our designs across multiple breakpoints. Our design systems include specifications for how elements should behave across different screen sizes to ensure consistency and usability.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do you incorporate accessibility into your design process?',
          answer: 'Accessibility is integrated throughout our design process. We follow WCAG guidelines, ensuring appropriate color contrast, text sizes, and interactive element sizing. We design with keyboard navigation and screen readers in mind, provide text alternatives for non-text content, and test with accessibility tools. Our goal is to create inclusive designs that work well for all users, including those with disabilities.'
