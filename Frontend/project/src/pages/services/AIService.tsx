          question: 'How much data do we need to implement an AI solution?',
          answer: 'The amount of data required depends on the complexity of the problem and the type of AI solution. Generally, machine learning models perform better with more data, but there are techniques for working with limited data sets. During our initial assessment, we can evaluate your existing data and advise on whether its sufficient or if additional data collection is needed.'

        {
          question: 'Can you explain how the AI makes decisions?',
          answer: 'Yes, we prioritize explainable AI (XAI) in our solutions. We implement techniques that help explain model predictions and decisions in human-understandable terms. This is particularly important in regulated industries or when AI is used for critical decision-making. We can provide various levels of explanation depending on your needs, from simple feature importance to detailed decision paths.'
